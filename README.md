<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## ✨ Overview

![screenshot](.github/layout.gif)

The project consists of a creation of a 404 page not found being the design responsive.

### 🐧 My impression

This project took a lot of attention to detail, since to deal with a responsive layout I have to make several changes and concepts that I didn't use before. The challenge motivated me to look for more about good practices within CSS, how much responsiveness and meaning to the user. Overall I conclude that I have a long way to go and a lot of content to learn!
